CRITICAL
- proper serialisation/parsing of Union
- GraphNodeUnion helper methods (i.e. mapBySubtype)
- matchRelationBySubtype

FEATURES
- relateToDynamic() relation operation
    - allows you to set relationship properties per node being connected (via callback fn)

IMPROVEMENTS
- allow using older versions of Cypher
- add custom exception types
- deep merging of query data
- utilities to help better conditional logic (at runtime level - i.e. to produce different queries)
- remove superfluous RETURN count(null)

OTHER NOTES:

  SUMMARY OF $updateNode() OPERATIONS:
      one
        - relateTo<one>() (provided node must be found)
        - replace() (if provided node not found, no action taken)

      optional
        - relateTo<one | optional>() (if provided node not found, no action taken)
        - replace() (if provided node not found, no action take)
        - replaceOrRemove() (if provided not found, still disconnect)
        - remove()

      many (array):
        - relateTo<any>()
        - disconnect()
        - disconnectStrict() (error if trying to disconnect something not connected)
        - disconnectAll()
        - replace() (combination of disconnectAll followed by relateTo())
